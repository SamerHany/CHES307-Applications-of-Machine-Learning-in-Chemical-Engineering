## YouTube Playlist:

- The existing YouTube playlist has been removed.
- A new playlist will be created soon, presenting the course topics in a revised order.
- To enhance accessibility, the new playlist will include introductory videos for all algorithms used in the course.
- The new playlist will also include topis not discussed in this course, so I'll probably create a new _GitHub Repository_ for it.
- The links to the new playlist and repository will be added here as soon as I get a chance to start working on them :)
